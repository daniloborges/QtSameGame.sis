# Samegame with Nokia Qt Quick

For history sake here is my old symbian port of Qt's Samegame.
It was published for Symbian^3 devices with source code hosted at projects.developer.nokia.com. 

> I don't know how to compile to a .sis today, but I belive that it can be compiled for desktop.

Enjoy all the memories!
